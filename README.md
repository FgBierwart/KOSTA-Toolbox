# STAKOOP (Stability Koopman)-Toolbox
The toolbox presented is based on the paper [] and estimates the basin of attraction of general vector field (polynomial and non-polynomial) using the Koopman operator framework. Hereafter, we detailed the main functions needed for the construction of the Lyapunov functions and its validation. 

# Construction of The Lyapunov function. 
The construction of the Lyapunov function is based on functions : main.m and Eigenfunction.m.
